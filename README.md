The goal of learngganimate is to record the discoveries of an intrepid
group of animation explorers in the wild, amazing jungle of [`gganimate`
package](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate)

We aim to create documentation and share our user experience for this
amazing, yet sparsly documented package.

we collectively set our minds to the task of exploring the gganimate
package.

We record our discoveries here for posterity
