## spirit

    The spirit of this project is very much we welcome any and all contributions.

    During ozunconf18 our process was like a jam session between kind, lovely people who had each picked up an instrument they had either never or barely played before. Accidental art was superfun to share, we'd love if you include your 'missteps'.

**Turn off the internal critic/editor voice and jump in.**

- Pick up an issue or add issues

    Sure, we have been trying to add issues as ideas come to us - so if an existing one tickles your fancy #goforit.  Not limited to existing issues listed on github by any stretch though. Especially welcome examples of functions we haven't covered yet.  Just adding an issue or commenting on an issue is a great contribution on its own.

-  Write a few paragraphs on something you don't understand

    You could write about how you don't understand something (and not produce any animation - I'd love reading things like that).  Turn off the internal critic/editor voice and jump in.

- Add your own example to already existing examples

    You could add your own example to the ones already there.  The more the merrier.  Different data , different geoms, different pictures - its all great


## process

### Source Files

    The pages themselves we have been creating as R markdown files with the output format of github_document.  In the first chunk it's worth turning caching on if you have animations.  See the first few lines of some of the other files for examples.

### Fixing typos

    Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. These files will generally have the `.Rmd` extension.
